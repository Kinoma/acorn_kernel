Marvell Armada CPU reset controller
===================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,armada-<chip>-cpu-reset"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet for the CPU reset register
- #reset-cells: 1, which allows to pass the CPU hardware ID when
  referencing this cpu reset block. See the example below.

cpurst: cpurst@20800 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-xp-cpu-reset";
	reg = <0x20800 0x20>;
	reset-cells = <1>;
};

And to associate a CPU to its reset controller:

cpu@0 {
	device_type = "cpu";
	compatible = "marvell,sheeva-v7";
	reg = <0>;
	clocks = <&cpuclk 0>;
	resets = <&cpurst 0>;
};
