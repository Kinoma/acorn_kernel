Fixed link Device Tree binding
------------------------------

Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
binding allows to describe a "fixed link".

Such a fixed link situation is described within an Ethernet device
Device Tree node using a 'fixed-link' property, composed of 5
elements:

 1. A fake PHY ID, which must be unique accross all fixed-link PHYs in
    the system.
 2. The duplex (1 for full-duplex, 0 for half-duplex)
 3. The speed (10, 100, 1000)
 4. The pause setting (1 for enabled, 0 for disabled)
 5. The asym pause setting (1 for enabled, 0 for disabled)

Example:

ethernet@0 {
	...
	fixed-link = <1 1 1000 0 0>;
	...
};
