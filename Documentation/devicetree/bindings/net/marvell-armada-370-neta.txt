* Marvell Armada 370 / Armada XP Ethernet Controller (NETA)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-370-neta".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- phy-mode: The interface between the SoC and the PHY (a string that
  of_get_phy_mode() can understand)
- clocks: a pointer to the reference clock for this device.

Optional properties:

- phy: A phandle to a phy node defining the PHY address (as the reg
  property, a single integer). Note: if this property isn't present,
  then fixed link is assumed, and the 'fixed-link' property is
  mandatory.
- fixed-link: A 5 elements array that describe a fixed link, see
  fixed-link.txt for details. Note: if a 'phy' property is present,
  this 'fixed-link' property is ignored.

Examples:

ethernet@d0070000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-370-neta";
	reg = <0xd0070000 0x2500>;
	interrupts = <8>;
	clocks = <&gate_clk 4>;
	status = "okay";
	phy = <&phy0>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii-id";
};

ethernet@d0070000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-370-neta";
	reg = <0xd0070000 0x2500>;
	interrupts = <8>;
	clocks = <&gate_clk 4>;
	status = "okay";
	fixed-link = <1 1 1000 0 0>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii-id";
};
